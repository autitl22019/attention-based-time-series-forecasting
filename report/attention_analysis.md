Attention Weight Interpretability Analysis
Attention mechanisms provide an important advantage over traditional sequence models by enabling interpretability in time series forecasting. In this project, the attention-based LSTM model learns to assign different importance weights to past time steps when generating a forecast, rather than relying uniformly on the entire input sequence. These attention weights reflect how much each historical observation contributes to the final prediction.
The synthetic dataset used in this project contains a linear trend, seasonal fluctuations, Gaussian noise, and a structural break introduced after a specific time index. This controlled design allows meaningful interpretation of learned attention patterns. When visualizing attention weights across multiple test sequences, clear and consistent patterns emerge that align with known characteristics of the data.
One prominent observation is that attention weights tend to peak around recent time steps close to the prediction horizon. This behavior is expected, as recent observations often carry the most relevant short-term information for forecasting. However, unlike a simple LSTM baseline that implicitly encodes this information in its hidden state, the attention mechanism explicitly highlights which recent values are prioritized during prediction.
Additionally, attention weights show recurring peaks at time steps corresponding to seasonal maxima and minima. This indicates that the model has learned to associate similar seasonal phases with future outcomes. For example, when forecasting during an upward seasonal cycle, the model places higher attention on past observations from similar seasonal positions. This behavior demonstrates that attention helps the model capture periodic dependencies more effectively than the baseline model.
A particularly important finding is the increased attention assigned to observations near the structural break region. After the structural break occurs, the model learns to reduce reliance on earlier pre-break observations and instead focuses more heavily on post-break data points. This adaptive behavior suggests that the attention mechanism helps mitigate the negative impact of outdated historical patterns, improving robustness in non-stationary environments.
Compared to the baseline LSTM model, which compresses all historical information into a single hidden state, the attention-based model offers a more flexible context representation. This flexibility contributes directly to improved forecasting accuracy, as reflected in lower RMSE and MAE values. More importantly, attention weights provide transparency, allowing practitioners to inspect why the model made a particular prediction.
Despite these advantages, attention-based interpretability has limitations. Attention weights indicate relative importance but do not imply causality. High attention values do not guarantee that a time step alone determines the prediction; rather, they represent how the model distributes focus given its learned parameters. Additionally, attention patterns may vary across sequences, requiring analysis over multiple test samples to avoid misleading conclusions.
In summary, the attention mechanism significantly enhances both predictive performance and interpretability. By explicitly identifying influential historical time steps related to seasonality, recent trends, and structural changes, the model provides valuable insights into temporal dynamics that are not accessible in traditional LSTM architectures.
