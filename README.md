## Project Directory Structure

The project is organized into clearly separated modules to align with best practices and deliverable requirements:

- `data/`: Synthetic data generation script  
- `models/`: Baseline LSTM and Attention-based LSTM model definitions  
- `experiments/`: Training and evaluation logic  
- `results/`: Saved metrics and attention visualizations  
- `report/`: Hyperparameter tuning documentation and attention analysis  

This modular structure improves clarity, reproducibility, and evaluation transparency.
